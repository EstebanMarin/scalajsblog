# Blog
I decided I wanted to start bloging. But who needs complicated tools when you can make software yourself.
# front-end
- [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [daisyui](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/)
- [Tailwind cheatsheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet)
## Prepare the client
1. At first, run `yarn install` within `frontend/js`.
2. Build the tailwind based CSS with `npx tailwind -i src/main/index.css -o ./target/dist/output.css`
